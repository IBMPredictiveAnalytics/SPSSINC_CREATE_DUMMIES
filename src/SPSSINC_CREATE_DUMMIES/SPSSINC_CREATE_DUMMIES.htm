  <h1>Create a Set of Dummy Variables from Values of a
  Variable</h1>This procedure accepts a list of variables and
  produces a set of dummy variables representing their values. It
  can produce dummies for individual variables, dummies for two-way
  interaction terms, and/or dummies for three-way interactions. It
  passes the data ignoring any cases excluded by the current filter
  and creates dummies for the values found.

  <p>For scale variables, by default, it produces just one variable
  instead of dummies which can be using in producing interaction
  terms.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Create Dummy Variables for.</span>
  Choose variables from which to create sets of dummy variables.
  Typically these would be categorical variables, but scale
  variables can be usefully selected for building interaction
  terms. Both string and numeric variables can be used, but date
  and time variables are not allowed.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Main Effect Dummy Variables.</span>
  Check the box <span name=".screen">Create main-effect
  dummies</span> to create a set of dummy variables for each
  selected variable.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Root Names.</span> Specify names to be
  used as the prefix of all the dummy variables for each variable
  selected. Enter as many names are there are variables selected,
  separated by a blank. The dummy names will have the form
  rootname_n. If a variable with that name already exists, it is
  replaced.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Macro Name.</span> If names are
  entered in this field, a macro will be created for each set of
  dummy variables or scale variable. Enter as many names are there
  are variables selected if macro generation is required. It is
  conventional to start each macro name with "!".</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Two-Way Interactions and Three-Way
  Interactions.</span> Follow the same procedure as for Main Effect
  Dummy Variables, but enter only a single root name and macro name
  (if desired). Dummy names will have the form<br>
  rootname_m_n,<br>
  and existing variables will be replaced.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Dummy Variable Labels</span> By
  default, labels for the dummy variables are constructed from the
  input variable name and the appropriate value label. Select
  <span class=".screen">Use values</span> to use the values
  instead. If a value is not labelled, the value itself is used in
  the label.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Value Order.</span> Choose
  <span class=".screen">Ascending</span> or <span class=
  ".screen">Descending</span> for the sort order of the dummy
  variables. This is mainly useful in connection with generating a
  macro.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Omit first dummy category from macro
  definitions.</span> Check this box to omit the first dummy
  variable from each macro definition. This is convenient for the
  REGRESSION procedure in order to avoid having a singular
  regressor matrix. If there are no interaction terms being
  generated, this means that the first dummy for each variable is
  omitted from the macro definition. If there are interaction
  terms, variables involving that category for any of the input
  variables are omitted from the macro definition.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Which categories are considered as first
  depends on the Value Order setting.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Scale variables are not affected by this
  setting.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Measurement Level Usage.</span>
  Categorical variables produce a dummy for each distinct values.
  Scale variables are represented by a single variable. Choose
  <span class=".screen">Do not create dummies for scale variable
  values</span> for this behavior. Choose <span class=
  ".screen">Create dummies for all variables</span> to ignore the
  measurement level and generate a variable for each value even for
  scale variables.</p>

  <h2>Additional Features</h2>

  <p>This dialog generates syntax for the SPSSINC CREATE DUMMIES
  extension command. To display help for this command, run the
  following syntax:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">SPSSINC CREATE DUMMIES /HELP.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>This dialog requires the Integration Plug-In for Python and
  the SPSSINC CREATE DUMMIES extension command. For IBM® SPSS®
  Statistics 19 and higher, the Plug-In and the extension command
  are installed with the Essentials for Python package. For more
  information, see How to Get Integration Plug-Ins, under Core
  System &gt; Frequently Asked Questions in the IBM SPSS Statistics
  Help system. If you downloaded SPSSINC CREATE DUMMIES from the
  SPSS Community, then please follow the instructions in the
  associated readme file.</p><br>
